[Protoplanetary
disks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protoplanetary_disk) are rotating
disks of gas and dust surrounding stars. Observations with the [ALMA
observatory](https://www.almaobservatory.org/) show that [these disks
have gaps and sometimes
spirals](https://www.almaobservatory.org/en/images/animation-of-the-20-alma-images-of-dsharp-project/),
which are believed to be carved by planets. In one of these disks,
[the presence of a planet has been confirmed by direct
imaging](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/link_gateway/2018A%26A...617A..44K/PUB_HTML)
with the [Very Large
Telescope](https://www.hq.eso.org/public/teles-instr/paranal-observatory/vlt/). In
another one, [a planet has been detected by measuring precisely the
gas kinematics around the
star](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41550-019-0852-6): in a
protoplanetary disk, the gas is in Keplerian rotation around the
star, but planets disturb this motion. These studies
demonstrate that protoplanetary disks are the birthplace of
planets. Determining how and when these disks are formed is,
therefore, important for understanding the formation of planetary
systems.

So far the vast majority of protoplanetary disks has been observed
around [T-Tauri](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_Tauri_star) or
[Herbig-Ae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbig_Ae/Be_star) *stars*,
which are a few million years old. However, a few protoplanetary disks
have also been detected around Class 0 or Class I *protostars*, for
example in [L1527](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature11610),
[L1448-N](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature20094) or
[BHB2007](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/366/6461/90). Class 0
protostars are only a few hundred thousand years old. The detection of
disks around these protostars shows that
protoplanetary disks may form and grow rapidly. However, it is still
unclear whether disks are common around these protostars.

In a [paper that has just been accepted to the Astronomy &
Astrophysics journal](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.06355), my colleagues
from the CALYPSO team and myself present the results of a survey of
protoplanetary disks in a sample of embedded (Class 0) protostars. We
used the [NOEMA
interferometer](https://www.iram-institute.org/EN/content-page-56-7-56-0-0-0.html)
to map the line emission of two carbon monoxide isotopologs,
<sup>13</sup>CO and C<sup>18</sup>O, and the line emission of sulfur
oxide (SO). We used these maps to measure the velocity of the gas
around the protostars to search for Keplerian rotation.

*Figure above: Left panel: C<sup>18</sup>O (1-0) line intensity map
(zeroth-order moment, black contours) and mean velocity (first-order
moment, color image) in the L1448-C Class 0 protostar. We detect a
velocity gradient (indicated with the black arrow) orthogonal to the
direction of the jet (shown by the blue and red lines). Right panel:

fit with a power-law, while the dashed curve shows a fit with a
Keplerian law.*

To measure the gas velocity around the protostars, we computed the
first-order moment maps of each line in each protostar of the
sample. We used these maps to detect velocity gradients and to measure
their amplitude and orientation (see the left panel of the figure
above for an example). We find that roughly half of the protostars of
our sample have velocity gradients orthogonal to their bipolar jets,
as expected if these gradients are due to disks. For each of these
disk candidate, we constructed a rotation curve, that is the velocity
as a function of the radius. For this, we fitted the centroid position
of the emission as a function of velocity directly from the
visibilities measured by the interferometer. This technique allowed us
to derive the rotation curve down to a radius about 50 au (see the
right panel of the figure above). We find that only two protostars
have a rotation curve consistent with Keplerian rotation: L1527 and
L1448-C. The presence of a disk on L1527 was already known, but this
is first detection of a disk in L1448-C.

Our study shows that disks with a radius larger that 50 au (the
typical scales probed by our observations) are rare in Class 0
protostars. This is in agreement with magneto-hydrodynamical (MHD)
simulations of the formation of disks, which predict [disks with
radius of a few tens of
au](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/2041-8205/830/1/L8). Disks
are probably present in all Class 0 protostars, but most of them are
too small to be detected with our NOEMA survey. Finding and
characterizing Keplerian disks around Class 0 protostars will require
observations at higher angular resolution (0.1'' or better). This can
only be achieved by ALMA.

The paper "Searching for kinematic evidence of Keplerian disks around
Class 0 protostars with CALYPSO" by Maret et al. is available on
[arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.06355).
