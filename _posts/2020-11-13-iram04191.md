Back in 2016, [Sibylle Anderl](http://sibylleanderl.net/), myself, and
our colleagues from the CALYPSO team, [studied the carbon monoxide
snow line in a sample of Class 0
protostars](http://arxiv.org/abs/1604.05121). As explained in a [a
previous post]({% post_url 2016-04-27-snowlines %}), we looked for the
snow line of carbon monoxide by observing C<sup>18</sup>O, an
isotopologue of this molecule, directly. But the CO-snow line is also
traced by another molecule: diazenylium,
N<sub>2</sub>H<sup>+</sup>. This species is chemically destroyed by CO
and should therefore form a ring outside the region where CO is
present in the gas. This pattern, a circular region of C<sup>18</sup>O
emission and an adjacent ring of N<sub>2</sub>H<sup>+</sup>, was indeed
observed in several protostars of our sample. But to our surprise, it
turned out that the situation was different in one of the sources,
IRAM 04191+24211 (IRAM 04191 for short).

IRAM 04191 is what is called a “very low luminosity object” (a
“VeLLO”). If a mass accretion rate is derived from its observed low
luminosity, it looks like IRAM 04191 is not going to reach a final
mass sufficient to become a proper low mass star. Instead it would
become a [brown dwarf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_dwarf), a
substellar object heavier than gas giants but not heavy enough to
start nuclear fusion of hydrogen. In this source, the
N<sub>2</sub>H<sup>+</sup> (1-0) line emission forms a partial ring,
with an inner radius of about 1100 astronomical units (au). The
C<sup>18</sup>O emission is located much closer to the protostar,
within a radius of about 70 au (see Fig. 1).

interferometer](https://www.iram-institute.org/EN/content-page-56-7-56-0-0-0.html)
towards IRAM 04191. The white solid circle shows the position of the
CO-snowline at the present day, while the dotted circle (left panel)
shows the snowline as it was during the luminosity burst. The
N<sub>2</sub>H<sup>+</sup> emission is detected at much farther
distance from the protostar than C<sup>18</sup>O. The white lines in
the bottom left corners of each plot show the physical scales in
astronomical units. The ellipses in the bottom right corners show the
angular resolution of the observations. Adapted from Anderl et
al. (2020). The contours show the 3, 6, 9 and 12σ emission levels.*

Using numerical models of the protostellar envelope and its chemistry,
we could show that this peculiar chemical pattern can be explained if
the luminosity of IRAM 04191 had changed in the past. This conclusion
uses the fact that chemistry can be used to look back in time. Because
chemical reactions take a certain amount of time, sometimes chemical
pattern still trace physical conditions that since have long
changed. So when IRAM 04191 had a luminosity outburst in the past, the
temperature in the surrounding cloud was higher and the snow line was
further out, as it is still traced by N<sub>2</sub>H<sup>+</sup>. When
the burst was over, the temperature went down again. But while CO was
fast to be bound in ices again, the reformation of
N<sub>2</sub>H<sup>+</sup> in the gas phase took longer even though
there was no CO anymore to destroy it: Thus the observed gap between
C<sup>18</sup>O and N<sub>2</sub>H<sup>+</sup>. This is illustrated in
Fig. 2, that shows the predicted C<sup>18</sup>O and
N<sub>2</sub>H<sup>+</sup> as a function of time since the end of the
outburst.

abundances in IRAM 04191 as a function of time since the luminosity

snowline. Adapted from Anderl et al. (2020).*

According these models, the luminosity burst should have occurred no
longer than a thousand years ago from now and made IRAM 04191 shine
more than 150-fold as luminous as it appears today. Assuming that
bursts like this happen roughly every 13,000 years as indicated by
models and observations, this means that IRAM 04191 will indeed be
able to reach a final mass of about 20 percent that of the Sun -- and
become a proper low mass star.  The result demonstrates that the
accretion history of very young protostars can be very dynamic.

observations of the very-low-luminosity Class 0 protostar IRAM
04191+1522” by Anderl et al. is available on
