This week at the
[6th Zermatt ISM symposium](https://www.astro.uni-koeln.de/zermatt2015),
[Paul Goldsmith](https://science.jpl.nasa.gov/people/Goldsmith/) gave
a very inspiring talk in honor of the physics Nobel prize laureate
[Charles H. Townes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_H._Townes),
who passed way earlier this year at an age of almost 100. Paul, was
one of the many graduate students of Townes, described him as an
exceptional scientist and an inspiring teacher. One of the lessons
Paul learned from his adviser is the following:

<blockquote>It's good to bounce ideas at every stage of their
development. This is what makes science fun -- Paul Goldsmith,
citing Charles Townes</blockquote>

Sadly, we don't bounce ideas that much these days. Recently, a
colleague at a conference told me that he has just submitted an
article to Nature that may interest me. When I asked him what was the
paper about, he answered that he couldn't tell me, because the paper
wasn't accepted yet. I never saw the paper in Nature, so it was
probably rejected by the editor (this is the fate of about 90% of the
paper that are submitted this journal).

Ironically, sharing ideas with colleagues is much easier today than it
was back in the seventies when defended PhD
thesis. [Twitter](http://www.twitter.com) allows to communicate our
research results with scientists from all over the world. Online
editors such as [Authorea](http://www.authorea.com) allow for open
discussions on papers at all stage of their writing, and even for
[open peer review](https://www.authorea.com/users/2/articles/20770/_show_article). So
why don't we share ideas more?

In a discussion during the conference, Paul told me that he thinks
this is because science is much more competitive nowadays. Indeed, we
all spend a large fraction of our time writing funding proposal to
obtain research grants and telescope time. Getting research funds is
becoming increasingly difficult -- for example the success rate for
[ANR (French National Research Agency)](http://www.agence-nationale-recherche.fr/en/project-based-funding-to-advance-french-research/)
proposals in astronomy is only 8-9% this year. The pressure factor for
[ALMA](http://www.almaobservatory.org) observing time in Europe is
about 8, which means that only 1 proposal out of 8 get
accepted. Presumably it was easier for Townes to get telescope time on
Mont Wilson, and to get funds for his students (Townes had up to 12
students at a time).

Yet, I don't think that this competition should make us reluctant to
share ideas among our colleagues. Bouncing ideas not only makes
science *fun*, I am convinced that it also makes science *better*.
