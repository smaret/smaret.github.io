I am an astrophysicist, currently working as a CNRS junior staff
researcher at the
[Institut de Plan√©tologie et d'Astrophysique de
Grenoble](https://ipag.osug.fr).
My research interests include star and
planet formation, astrochemistry, and radio/infrared astronomy.

I use this blog to share my recent research results with my
colleagues. However, I try to write my blog posts so they can be
understood by anyone with a basic scientific background.

Please feel free to contact me
[by email](mailto:sebastien.maret@univ-grenoble-alpes.fr)
if you have questions. You can also use
[Twitter](http://twitter.com/sebastienmaret) to reach me or to comment
on this blog. Happy reading!
